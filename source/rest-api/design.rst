Design
======

The Design API provided by OpenProtein.AI allows you to design new protein sequences and structures.

Sequence generation is done using **Genetic Algorithm** using the property ``predictors`` that you train on your datasets.

Currently, we support the following design approaches:

- **Genetic Algorithm** for sequence generation
- **RFdiffusion** for structure generation
