Demo Datasets
=============

Aliphatic amidase (AMIE_PSEAE)
-------------------------------

This dataset is a single mutation site saturating dataset from Wrenbeck, Azouz, and Whitehead 
(:cite:year:`Wrenbeck2017-bk`) containing
activity measurements for enzyme variants against three different substrates. The parent sequence is AMIE_PSEAE (UniProt identifier
`P11436 <https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11436>`__).

6,819 entries with 3 properties.

Antibody heavy chain (14H)
--------------------------

This dataset contains binding affinity measurements to the target for a
random mutagenesis library containing single, double, and triple mutants
of an antibody heavy chain variable region from Li et al. (:cite:year:`Li2022-te`). Mutations were limited to CDRs 1, 2, and 3. Measurements are log base 10 of the binding Kd in nM.

Antibody light chain (14L)
---------------------------

This dataset contains binding affinity measurements to the target for a
random mutagenesis library containing single, double, and triple mutants
of an antibody light chain variable region from Li et al. (:cite:year:`Li2022-te`). Mutations were limited to CDRs 1, 2, and 3. Measurements are log base 10 of the binding Kd in
nM.

14,339 entries with 1 property.

Aminoglycoside 3\'-phosphotransferase (KKA2_KLEPN)
---------------------------------------------------

This is a single mutation site saturating dataset from Melnikov et al. (:cite:year:`Melnikov2014-hw`)
containing measurements of E.
coli growth in the presence of six different antibiotics. This protein
is a kinase that confers antibiotic resistance, hence, growth measures
the activity of the kinase on these antibiotic substrates. The parent
sequence is KKA2_KLEPN (UniProt identifier
`P00552 <https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00552>`__).

5,279 entries with 6 properties.
