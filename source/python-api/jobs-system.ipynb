        "The OpenProtein.AI platform operates with an asynchronous framework.

You can check a jobâ€™s status using the `refresh()` and `done()` methods on this Future Class. If you wish to wait for the results, you can use the `wait()` method, or the `get()` method if the results are already completed.\n",
