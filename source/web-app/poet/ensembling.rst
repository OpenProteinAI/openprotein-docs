Ensembling
==========

Ensembling multiple prompts increases the diversity of generated outputs. Sample a single prompt independently from the MSA by setting the **Number of prompts to ensemble field** to 1, or use multiple randomly sampled prompts by entering a number >1.

OpenProtein.AI can ensemble up to 15 prompts, but we recommend using 3 to 5.
Ensembling over multiple prompts improves performance when predicting variant effects, but takes longer to do predictions and sampling.
