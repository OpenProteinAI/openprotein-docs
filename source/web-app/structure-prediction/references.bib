  abstract  = "Large biomolecular structures are being determined
               experimentally on a daily basis using established techniques
               such as crystallography and electron microscopy. In addition,
               emerging integrative or hybrid methods (I/HM) are producing
               structural models of huge macromolecular machines and
               assemblies, sometimes containing 100s of millions of
               non-hydrogen atoms. The performance requirements for
               visualization and analysis tools delivering these data are
               increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online,
               web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools was
               previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol
               suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly
               initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the
               strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by
               RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol* Viewer enables 3D visualization
               and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental
               data, together with capabilities for displaying structure
               quality, functional, or biological context annotations.
               High-performance graphics and data management allows users to
               simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed)
               protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation
               trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM
               structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe
               and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party
               services. Mol* Viewer is open source and freely available at
               https://molstar.org/.",

  abstract = "Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary
              information in multiple sequence alignments to predict protein
              structure. We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level
              protein structure from primary sequence using a large language
              model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to
              15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein
              structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in
              an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure
              prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization
              of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct
              the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617
              million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million
              that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into
              the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.",
