## Job system
Our endpoints follow an asynchronous POST and GET framework. Once you initiate a task via our POST endpoints, the system schedules the job. This means that even for tasks that may take a while to complete, your request will return immediately. Instead of waiting for the final results, you will receive a job ID in response to your initial request.

This job ID is a unique identifier that you can use to track your job. You can use this job ID with our GET endpoints to query the status of your task.

If the job is still in progress, the API will return a response indicating that the job is not yet complete. Once the job has completed, a call to the same endpoint with your job ID will allow you to retrieve your results. You can also use the /jobs endpoints to poll the status of a job before fetching all the results.

Our API is designed this way to ensure that you are not kept waiting for long tasks to complete and can track and manage your tasks at your convenience.

Remember, your job ID is unique and essential for retrieving the results of your task. Please keep a note of this ID once you initiate a task.
