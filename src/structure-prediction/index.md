Using open source models like ESMfold, @Lin2023-cw, our structure prediction tool leverages the ESM2 protein language model to derive meaningful representations from your protein sequence. The ESMFold structure prediction neural network then uses these representations to directly forecast the 3D coordinates of your proteinâ€™s constituent atoms.

For detailed information about the model, please refer [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574){target="_blank"}.
