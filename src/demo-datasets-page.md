## Aliphatic amidase (AMIE_PSEAE)

This dataset is a single mutation site saturating dataset from
@Wrenbeck2017-bk containing
activity measurements for enzyme variants against three different
substrates. The parent sequence is AMIE_PSEAE (UniProt identifier
P11436).

6,819 entries with 3 properties.

## Antibody heavy chain (14H)

This dataset contains binding affinity measurements to the target for a
random mutagenesis library containing single, double, and triple mutants
of an antibody heavy chain variable region from @Li2022-te. Mutations were limited to
CDRs 1, 2, and 3. Measurements are log base 10 of the binding Kd in nM.

7,476 entries with 1 property.

## Antibody light chain (14L)

This dataset contains binding affinity measurements to the target for a
random mutagenesis library containing single, double, and triple mutants
of an antibody light chain variable region from @Li2022-te. Mutations were limited
to CDRs 1, 2, and 3. Measurements are log base 10 of the binding Kd in
nM.

14,339 entries with 1 property. [Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=17fbByoS2pF6_e8xAVdMNcIF1gifaEzd2)

## Aminoglycoside 3\'-phosphotransferase (KKA2_KLEPN)

This is a single mutation site saturating dataset from @Melnikov2014-hw. containing measurements of E.
coli growth in the presence of six different antibiotics. This protein
is a kinase that confers antibiotic resistance, hence, growth measures
the activity of the kinase on these antibiotic substrates. The parent
sequence is KKA2_KLEPN (UniProt identifier P00552)

5,279 entries with 6 properties.
