## Saving sequence variants as a library

Libraries serve as a repository of all your designed sequence variants.
This enables you to reference previously created variants easily.

You can also save your library within the app. Click the "Save as
library..." button and enter a name for your library.

</p>

This will take you to a new page with the sequence variants you
selected. You can navigate back to these sequences from the library
section of the navigation menu.

That's it! Now you can download your designed sequence variants to
perform any additional analysis and synthesize your library!
