Fold
====

The Fold API provided by OpenProtein.ai allows you to generate protein structures from both proprietary and open source models.

You can list the available models with `/fold/models` and view a model summary (including usage, citations, limitations and more) with `/fold/model/{model_id}`.

Currently, we support the following models:

- **ESMFold**: Open-sourced ESMFold model.
- **AlphaFold2**: Open-sourced implementation using colabfold.
