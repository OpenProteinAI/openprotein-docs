You can do so by clicking “Upload dataset” in the navigation panel or the project landing page will open a file explorer from which you can select your dataset file.\n\nWe’ll use AMIE_PSEAE_Whitehead, a deep mutational scanning dataset from Wrenbeck et al which is included as a demo dataset with this walkthrough. This dataset has activity measurements for single substitution mutants of aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on three substrates (acetamide, isobutyramide, and propionamide). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of short-chain aliphatic amides into carboxylates and ammonia.\n\n\n\nBy default, it will be the name of your uploaded file but you have the option of renaming your dataset . You can also add an optional description. If you selected the wrong file by accident, the “Change…” button will take you back to the file explorer to select a different file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA Mutagenesis dataset is expected to be uploaded as a CSV formatted table. It should have one column containing the full sequence of each variant and additional columns with measurement values associated with each variant.\nIt’s ok if some of the variants are missing measurements.\nYour sequence variants can also be specified using typical mutation codes (e.g., M1A or R25L, encoding an M-&gt;A substitution at position 1 or R-&gt;L substitution at position 25, respectively). If your table has mutation codes, you will also need to specify the full wildtype sequence in the “Sequence options” dropdown. The app will use this to enumerate the full sequence of each variant.\n\n\nThe app will try to auto-detect your sequence column based on the column name. If it can’t find the column, you can manually select it in the “Sequence options” dropdown.\n\n\n\nIf your table has variants encoded using mutant codes, you need to include the wildtype sequence of your protein.\n\n\n\nWhen you click “Upload,” your dataset will appear in the Datasets section of the navigation panel and you will be redirected to a new page for your dataset."

You can also toggle properties on and off using the check marks and change how the individual properties are weighted in the score. See the note on design criteria below in the “Design optimized variants” section for more information. The right side of the panel shows the relationship between variant scores and the color map. You can change the min, mid, and max values to adjust the color scaling of the heatmap.\n\n\nFor this dataset, let’s look for variants likely to have activity &gt;1 on all three substrates. We also set the min score for the colormap to -20 to get better color resolution of the possible variants.\n\nSince we started with a high activity sequence, we can see that most variants are predicted to be less likely to achieve our design criteria. These are colored red by default.\n\nThere’s only one variant that our models predict are more likely to achieve the design objective than, which is colored blue. Hovering that cell of the heatmap will show more information about it.\n\nYou can look for variants that might be better for other design objectives by editing the scoring criteria in the heatmap options drawer.

You can edit the name of this design run in the name text box. We’ve changed it to “AMIE all &gt;1.” You can also specify specific positions within the sequence to mutate. If you don’t, all positions will be considered. The single site potentials found on the predict page can be a useful way to identify a limited number of positions, but we’ll just consider all positions here. You can also set the design algorithm to find optimal variants at shells of similarity to your dataset by selecting the “Use number of mutations criteria” option. This can be helpful if you want to explore tradeoffs between the number of mutations in each variant and the predicted properties. When a criteria is set for multiple properties, the algorithm will search for variants that fall along the Pareto front of those criteria. More information on the design criteria can be found here.\nBy default, the design algorithm will run for 10 steps. If you want to generate more candidate sequences and give the algorithm more time to find, potentially, better variants, this can be increased. Let’s set it to 20.\n\n\n\nThen click “Generate design” to start the algorithm. This will save the design so it’s accessible from the navigation panel. It can take some time for the algorithm to run.

This means that you can use the model to generate single substitution, combinatorial variant libraries, or a bespoke high-diversity library, prior to making any measurements.\nProts2prot controls sequence generation via a prompt, which is defined as a set of sequences that encodes information about the local fitness landscape and co-evolutionary patterns of your given protein of interest. One way to build this prompt is by using a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of your protein of interest using sequences across evolutionary lineages. Because these sequences share an evolutionary relationship, they contain information about the local fitness landscape of the protein. Prots2prot is able to infer the evolutionary process driving the generation of these sequences, and hence not only sample new sequences, but also score the likelihood of seeing a given sequence under this process.\nChorismate mutase is a important enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to prephenate. In this tutorial, we will use Prots2prot to generate a prospective de novo variant library for chorismate mutase."

The typical strategy in protein engineering is to search the local sequence space near a known sequence by generating single and combinatorial variant libraries.

In this case, you will want to cast your net as wide as possible by sampling a variety of stable and functional proteins.

However, these either cannot be found via a simple greedy optimization strategy, or may take an unreasonable number of steps to reach it.\n\n\n\n\nThis greedy algorithm is going in the direction of the best local improvementbut is actually moving further away from the global peak.\n\n\n\nYou want to hedge your bets. Unfortunately, similar sequences are likely to share other possibly unwanted, but correlated properties. For example, a set of similar sequences may all have high activity but may also all be unstable or poorly expressed. Just as with investing, it is good to diversity your portfolio.\n\nTo generate high-diversity libraries, we can use the Generate sequences tool.\n\n\n\nAs in the single-site analysis tool, we have to specify the prompt. We will again use the sequence for chorismate mutase in E. coli. to seed the MSA. Since chorismate mutase is a relatively short protein, we will set the maximum generated protein length to 200. We also set the number of sequences to generate to 100. Hitting run then dispatches the generate job.\n\n\n\nGenerate sequences\n\n\nThe results of the tool are returned in the Results tab as a table. Recall that the larger (less negative) the score, the higher the likelihood of the sequence under the model. We can use the table widget to filter our sequences to have some minimum score, and then export them for further analysis.\n\n\n\nFilter sequences\n\n\nHowever, looking at the table, we can already observe that only 1 sequence has a score higher than the original query sequence that we input in the original analysis. To generate more highly-scoring sequences, we might want to lower Top-p, which reduces the randomness of the sampling by only sampling from the top most likely amino acids up to the specified cumulative frequency. We can also lower the temperature, which emphasizes higher probability amino acids during sampling by raising the probability to the power of the temperature.\nLet’s try setting Top-p to 0.9! Here we can see that there are a lot more high-scoring sequences.\n\n\n\nFilter sequences\n\n\n:bulb: Hover the tooltips to learn about how the different parameters affect the results! Although we have set reasonable defaults for many of these parameters, we recommend that you also try playing around with them to customize your libraries."

If Prot2prot’s scores are predictive, this gives us confidence that the model has learned the underlying generative process and will be able to generate a good library.\n:bulb: How is it that Prots2prot scores can be predictive of function despite having never seen functional measurements? An excellent question! Well, it turns out that evolution has already done a lot of the work for us, and that there is a lot to learn from naturally occurring sequences. In fact, our experiments show that even though Prots2prot does not use any measurement information, Prots2prot scores correlate with functional measurements across diverse tasks in a wide variety of datasets. You can read more about these experiments in our upcoming preprint.\nLet’s evaluate Prot2prot’s scores against actual activity measurements for a high diversity variant library of chorismate mutase!\nTo evaluate query sequences against a given MSA, we can use the Create query tool."

    "section": "Design Criteria",
    "text": "Design Criteria\nProperty predictors in OpenProtein.AI are Bayesian. They output a distribution over possible values of the property for a variant. The mean is what you would get from a typical regression model, but our models also output a standard deviation which indicates how certain we are in the value of that property. Based on this distribution, we can calculate the probability that a sequence variant meets some design goal defined by the property value being greater than or less than some target value. This is how our design criteria are defined. The score given by the predictive models is the log probability that the sequence meets the defined design criteria.\nThis means that it is important to set reasonable target values for your design criteria, because it has a direct impact on the behaviour of the search algorithm. If the target value is set too ambitiously, then the algorithm will favor exploration by proposing variants with high uncertainty. Why? Because no variant will have expected property value at or beyond the target value, so variants with high uncertainties will be more likely to achieve the design criteria than sequences with low uncertainties. In other words, the model is certain that those variants will not achieve the design objective and it will explore high uncertainty variants instead. This will generally cause the algorithm to explore variants more distant from your mutagenesis dataset."
