OpenProtein's OP models is a set of machine learning tools designed to analyze and optimize sequences that have measured properties. If you don't have experimental data, use PoET to generate sequences.

If you do have experimental data, OP models tools allow you to:

- Use Models to train machine learning models and design sequences within your specified constraints.

- Use Substitution Analysis to make property predictions for a sequence and all of its single substitution variants.
- Use the Design tool to customize objectives for each project.
- Visualize data and the predicted structures of your generated sequences
