Optimization and Prediction Models Overview
============================================

OpenProtein.AI’s Optimization and Prediction Models (OP Models) are a set of machine learning tools designed to analyze and optimize sequences that have measured properties. If you don’t have experimental data, use `PoET <../poet/index.md>`__ to generate sequences. If you do have experimental data, create a project for each specific protein sequence you’re interested in exploring. OP Models allows you to:

- Visualize your data using different graphical formats.
- Use Models to train machine learning models and design sequences within your specified constraints.
- Use Substitution Analysis to make property predictions for a sequence and all of its single substitution variants.
- Use the Design tool to customize objectives for each project.

You can create unlimited projects to house different protein sequences.

To create a project, you will need a dataset formatted as a CSV table with columns containing the full sequence of each variant and their measurement values. Missing measurements are acceptable.

On the OpenProtein.AI home page, select **New Project**.

Name your project, then select **Create**.

Congratulations! You’re ready to `upload your dataset <./uploading-your-data.md>`__.
