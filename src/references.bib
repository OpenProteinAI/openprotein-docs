  abstract = "The rational design of enzymes is an important goal for both
              fundamental and practical reasons. Here, we describe a process to
              learn the constraints for specifying proteins purely from
              evolutionary sequence data, design and build libraries of
              synthetic genes, and test them for activity in vivo using a
              quantitative complementation assay. For chorismate mutase, a key
              enzyme in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, we
              demonstrate the design of natural-like catalytic function with
              substantial sequence diversity. Further optimization focuses the
              generative model toward function in a specific genomic context.
              The data show that sequence-based statistical models suffice to
              specify proteins and provide access to an enormous space of
              functional sequences. This result provides a foundation for a
              general process for evolution-based design of artificial
              proteins.",
