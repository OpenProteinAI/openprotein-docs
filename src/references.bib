  abstract = "The rational design of enzymes is an important goal for both
              fundamental and practical reasons. Here, we describe a process to
              learn the constraints for specifying proteins purely from
              evolutionary sequence data, design and build libraries of
              synthetic genes, and test them for activity in vivo using a
              quantitative complementation assay. For chorismate mutase, a key
              enzyme in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, we
              demonstrate the design of natural-like catalytic function with
              substantial sequence diversity. Further optimization focuses the
              generative model toward function in a specific genomic context.
              The data show that sequence-based statistical models suffice to
              specify proteins and provide access to an enormous space of
              functional sequences. This result provides a foundation for a
              general process for evolution-based design of artificial
              proteins.",

  abstract = "Therapeutic antibodies are an important and rapidly growing drug
              modality. However, the design and discovery of early-stage
              antibody therapeutics remain a time and cost-intensive endeavor.
              In this work, we present an end-to-end Bayesian, language
              model-based method for designing large and diverse libraries of
              high-affinity single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). We
              integrate target-specific binding affinities with information
              from millions of natural protein sequences in a probabilistic
              machine learning framework to design thousands of scFvs that are
              then empirically measured. In a head-to-head comparison with a
              directed evolution approach, we show that the best scFv generated
              from our method represents a 28.8-fold improvement in binding
              over the best scFv from the directed evolution. Additionally,
              99\% of the designed scFvs in our most successful library are
              improvements over the initial candidate scFv. By comparing a
              library's predicted success to actual measurements, we
              demonstrate our method's ability to explore tradeoffs between
              library success and diversity during the design phase and prior
              to experimental testing. The results of our work highlight the
              significant impact machine learning models can have on scFv
              development. We expect our end-to-end method to be broadly
              applicable and able to provide value to other protein engineering
              tasks. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Tristan Bepler is the

  abstract = "Deep mutational scanning has emerged as a promising tool for
              mapping sequence-activity relationships in proteins, ribonucleic
              acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. In this approach, diverse
              variants of a sequence of interest are first ranked according to
              their activities in a relevant assay, and this ranking is then
              used to infer the shape of the fitness landscape around the
              wild-type sequence. Little is currently known, however, about the
              degree to which such fitness landscapes are dependent on the
              specific assay conditions from which they are inferred. To
              explore this issue, we performed comprehensive
              single-substitution mutational scanning of APH(3')II, a Tn5
              transposon-derived kinase that confers resistance to
              aminoglycoside antibiotics, in Escherichia coli under selection
              with each of six structurally diverse antibiotics at a range of
              inhibitory concentrations. We found that the resulting local
              fitness landscapes showed significant dependence on both
              antibiotic structure and concentration, and that this dependence
              can be exploited to guide protein engineering. Specifically, we
              found that differential analysis of fitness landscapes allowed us
              to generate synthetic APH(3')II variants with orthogonal
              substrate specificities.",

  abstract = "Our lack of total understanding of the intricacies of how enzymes
              behave has constrained our ability to robustly engineer substrate
              specificity. Furthermore, the mechanisms of natural evolution
              leading to improved or novel substrate specificities are not
              wholly defined. Here we generate near-comprehensive
              single-mutation fitness landscapes comprising >96.3\% of all
              possible single nonsynonymous mutations for hydrolysis activity
              of an amidase expressed in E. coli with three different
              substrates. For all three selections, we find that the
              distribution of beneficial mutations can be described as
              exponential, supporting a current hypothesis for adaptive
              molecular evolution. Beneficial mutations in one selection have
              essentially no correlation with fitness for other selections and
              are dispersed throughout the protein sequence and structure. Our
              results further demonstrate the dependence of local fitness
              landscapes on substrate identity and provide an example of
