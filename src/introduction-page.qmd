# Introduction to OpenProtein

This article includes a high-level summary of core features, along with links to explore more
documentation for each area.

## Projects

This is the overall folder where your datasets, designs and libraries
will be housed in. You can create more than 1 project. Learn more about
[projects](dataset-page.qmd#creating-a-project).

## Datasets

Once you have uploaded your datasets, you will be able to view them
here. Our system automatically creates a UMAP, joint plot and histogram.
You will be able to upload multiple datasets. Learn more about
[uploading your datasets](dataset-page.qmd#uploading-a-dataset).

## Designs

The design module allows you to create the best base sequences based on
specific properties. Once you have run the design tool, you can find
your optimized sequences in this module. Learn more about [Design](design-page.qmd)

## Libraries

The Libraries module allows you to store your design sequences for easy
reference. Learn more about [Libraries](library-page.qmd).
