## What is a reference sequence?
A reference sequence is a sequence used to compare the generated results against. It can be your parent sequence or sequence of interest. 

## Adding a reference sequence
There are a few ways to upload or add your reference sequence. 
- During dataset upload
- Dataset table
- Design results table

### Uploading your dataset
When you upload your dataset and provide a parent sequence, the system will automatically set that parent sequence as the default reference sequence.

### Dataset and Design results table
To incorporate a reference sequence into the table, click on 'Add reference sequence' and paste your sequence. Your reference sequence will populate the first row of the table, while the remaining sequences will be displayed as locations where mutations have been introduced in comparison to the reference sequence. If you wish to view the complete amino acid sequence, click on 'Hide mutations.'
