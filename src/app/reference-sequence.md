## What is a reference sequence?
A reference sequence serves as the benchmark for comparing the generated results. It can either be your parent sequence or any sequence of interest that you want to use as a point of comparison.

### Inserting your reference sequence 
To incorporate a reference sequence into the table, click on 'Add reference sequence' and paste your sequence. It will populate the first row of the table, while the remaining sequences will be displayed as locations where mutations have been introduced in comparison to the reference sequence. If you wish to view the complete amino acid sequence, click on 'Hide mutations.'
